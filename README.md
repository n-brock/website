An advocate for User Centered Design and applying Human Factors evaluation methodologies to uncover inefficiencies (wicked problems) and enhance the experiences that are brought to life. 

## United States Army, Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C)

The Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) is to connect the Army with the broader AI community, identify and develop new AI technologies, and apply them to address challenges in the field. It aims to accelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions to improve decision-making, enhance warfighting capabilities, and advance the Army's readiness.   

**üö® CHALLENGE üö®**

**üë®‚Äçüîß My role**

My work focused on the management and facilitation of product experiences involving the use of artificial intelligence and predictive feature rich experience. Advocating early in the process to perform exploratory methods, our focus was in performing design audits to existing or in-development products as well as the preparation and conducting of heuristic reviews for the portfolio of AI2C products.

## Food and Drug Administration, Office of Laboratory Science and Safety (OLSS)

```
Time Period: 6 months
Focus: User Interface Design, User Experience Research, Design Thinking, Graphic Design 
```

The FDA's Office of Laboratory Science and Safety (OLSS) was established to enhance laboratory safety and science within the FDA. The Office is responsible for promoting and strengthening laboratory safety and scientific excellence within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It provides cross-cutting laboratory products, services, and systems (quality, safety, informatics, workforce, response readiness) support for CDC laboratories that conduct research, surveillance, and routine and emergency diagnostic testing, and develop diagnostic tests; (2) collaborates with the nation's laboratories (public health, clinical, industry, academic, and other government) to ensure scientifically advanced, timely, and efficient laboratory response and diagnostic testing; 

**üö® CHALLENGE üö®**

The office was established in 2017 to identify, investigate, and bring safety through the use of to the labortories throughout the United States. This multifaceted approach, focusing on organizational structures, best practices, incident investigation, and training, as well as creating a culture of safety and accountability would be the drivers for a safer experience within the laboratories.

**üë®‚Äçüîß My role**

To plan, conduct, and evaluate a Design Thinking session, later to assist in the creation of services and systems that will track the quality, safety, informatics, workforce, and response readiness. The project effort, ux activities involved for the Design Thinking and synthesizing of information gathered during a session held. 

**Future benefits of the efficiency established to enhance laboratory safety and science**

1.Reduced Incidents & Improved Efficiency, by focusing on workplace health and safety, laboratory safety, and quality, OLSS aims to minimize risks and potential incidents. A safer and more secure laboratory environment could translate to fewer disruptions, less downtime, and potentially lower costs related to accidents, thus indirectly supporting government efficiency. 
2. Improved Laboratory Quality, OLSS also aims to improve the quality and integrity of laboratory data and results.
Reliable and high-quality data can lead to better informed regulatory decisions and potentially more efficient processes. 
3. Potential Cost Savings, While not its primary goal, OLSS's focus on safety and quality could contribute to cost savings in the long run by minimizing accidents and improving the reliability of laboratory work. 


**What drives innovation for a product?** 

It involves having an understanding of communicating in a omni-channel approach, for users and their needs, the team and cross-functional collaboration,
